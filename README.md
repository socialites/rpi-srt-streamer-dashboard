# RPI SRT Streamer Dashboard

This is the repo for the dashboard that runs on each RPI SRT Streamer.

This repo gets cloned by the RPI SRT Streamer installer and runs on the RPI SRT Streamer.

It will be used to display the status of the RPI SRT Streamer and to control the RPI SRT Streamer.

The Pi will also be able to update the dashboard and pull the latest version of the dashboard from the repo.
